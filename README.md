This repository aims to facilitate the development of the package
[lcm](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/lcm). We do so by trying to increase the
reproducibility of insights that led to changes in `lcm` and by providing developer
documentation, designed to explain the inner workings of the `lcm` code base.
